# Intro
For a large projects very important to get every developer know, <br> 
what names he should use or which parts of code are already written. <br>
When everyone can see the general structure, development should go faster, right? <br>
So, let's create an imaginative outline language, universal for most programming languages.  <br>
Developers of any kind welcome!
# Basics
Outline Script should be easy for reading and writing on paper. <br>
So it contains only simple and familiar symbols.
### variable
```
V[name]( ?type)| ?value |
```
### array
```
A[name]( ?type )
```
### function
```
F[name](arg1, arg2, ..) | return |
```
### object
```
<[name]:
Something inside
>
```
### property
```
<[object]:
 .V[var]
 .A[arr]
 .F[func]()|0|
>
```
### class
```
<<[name](arg1, arg2, ..):
 .V[var]
 .A[arr]
 .F[func]()|0|
>>
```
